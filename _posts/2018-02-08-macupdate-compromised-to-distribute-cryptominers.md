The Mac OS app hosting website MacUpdate was [compromised and hosted binaries modified to include a cryptocurrency miner](https://securityboulevard.com/2018/02/new-mac-cryptominer-distributed-via-a-macupdate-hack/).
This hilights the risk of downloading program binaries from 3rd party websites. Always only ever download apps from official app stores or developers websites and take steps to verify authenticity! Most attackers when trojaning binaries in the past havn't bothered to modify hashsums or GPG signatures.
