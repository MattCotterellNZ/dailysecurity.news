Youtube gets in on the ["serving up cryptocurrency miners with ads" action.](https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2018/01/now-even-youtube-serves-ads-with-cpu-draining-cryptocurrency-miners/)
A solution to this problem is to use one of those raspberry pi's you have in a drawer somewhere and run [Pi-Hole](https://pi-hole.net/) to block ads on a DNS level for your entire network..
