There's a CVSS 10 rated (the worst you can get) [RCE in Cisco ASA WebVPN services.](https://threatpost.com/cisco-patches-critical-vpn-vulnerability/129694/)
[Cisco Advisory](https://tools.cisco.com/security/center/content/CiscoSecurityAdvisory/cisco-sa-20180129-asa1)
You better have a Cisco TAC/Support contract in order to get this patch, or just disable the WebVPN altogeather. There are no other work arounds.
